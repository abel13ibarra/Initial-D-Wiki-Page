                <h1>About the series</h1>
                <p>
                  Initial D (Japanese: 頭文字イニシャル D, Hepburn: Inisharu Dī) is a
                  Japanese street racing manga series written and
                  illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno. It was serialized in
                  Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine from
                  1995 to 2013, with the chapters collected into 48 tankōbon
                  volumes.
                  The story focuses on the world of illegal Japanese street
                  racing, where all the action is concentrated in the mountain
                  passes and
                  rarely in cities or urban areas, and with the drifting racing
                  style emphasized in particular. Professional race car driver
                  and pioneer of
                  drifting Keiichi Tsuchiya helped with editorial supervision.
                  The story is centered on the prefecture of Gunma, more
                  specifically on several mountains in the Kantō region and in
                  their surrounding cities and towns. Although some of the names
                  of the locations the characters race in have been
                  fictionalized, all of the locations in the series are based on
                  actual locations in Japan.

                <p>The racing action in "Initial D" is spread across six
                  distinct stages, each with its own unique challenges and
                  character developments. The first stage serves as the
                  introduction to the series, where we are introduced to the
                  protagonist, Takumi Fujiwara,
                  as he navigates the treacherous mountain passes of Akina. This
                  initial stage sets the tone for the series and provides a

              He acts as the delivery boy for his father's tofu business,
              driving his father's Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86) up to
              the top of the mountain every morning to deliver tofu to the
              hotels for the day.
              After defeating Keisuke Takahashi in an impromptu battle he was
              nicknamed the "White Ghost of Akina" and began racing on his own,
              occasionally representing
              the Akina SpeedStars in battle. He was eventually invited to join
              Project D as their downhill ace.</p>

              secondary protagonist of the Project D Arc.
              An ex-bosozoku gang member, he was introduced to street racing by
              his brother Ryosuke and joined his team, the Akagi RedSuns, and
              soon became their second best driver in his Mazda
              RX-7 Type R (FD3S). He and his brother are nicknamed
              "The Rotary Brothers", as they both drive cars with rotary
              engines. During the RedSuns expedition to Akina, he was
              defeated by Takumi Fujiwara in an impromptu battle,
              an event that helped kickstart Fujiwara's racing career and
              created a rivalry between the two.</p>

              Famously nicknamed Akagi's White Comet (赤城の白い彗星, Akagi no Shiroi

              achieve this goal.</p>

            <p class="lead">The AE86 series of the Toyota Corolla Levin and

              within the fifth generation Corolla range — marketed by Toyota
              from 1983 to 1987 in coupe and hatchback configurations. They were
              the last Corollas to offer rear-wheel drive.

              In classic Toyota code, the "A" represents the engine that came in
              the car (4A series), "E" represents the Corolla, "8" represents
              the fifth generation (E80 series) and "6" represents the variation
              within this generation.

              Toyota AE86 (Eight-Six, or Hachi-Roku) models are the most
              prominent type of car in the Initial D series, the most iconic of
              which is the Toyota Sprinter Trueno driven by Takumi Fujiwara and
